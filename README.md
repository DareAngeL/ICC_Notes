# ICC_Notes
This is a notes application for me to use it on my current college school. To save all the modules, organize, sort and access it easily
__*UNDER-DEVELOPMENT*__

# Features
1. All subjects will be sorted according to it's set day. For example, if the current day is Monday- all subjects that is for the current day will be brought on top of the list for easy accessibility without having to scroll down or search just to find the subject for the current day.
2. **Server-sided** - everytime you added a subject/module/contents it will automatically push/update the data to the server if you have internet connectivity. Otherwise, it will store the data to the cache and to internal storage, so the next time you open the app with internet connectivity, it will just automatically push/update the server.
3. **View-and-Hide contents search engine** - if you search on the contents of the module, it will only show the contents that has the keyword you are searching for and it will hide the others.

# TO-DO
1. Implement ColorPicker or import Android Holo ColorPicker library.
2. Implement manual text styling and colorpicking.
